# Netflix-Data-Visualization
This project analyses Netflix shows and movies through a modular pipeline. Each step of the pipeline- data preparation, cleaning, exploration, and visualizationâ€”is handled in separate Jupyter Notebooks. The entire workflow has been automated using Papermill to execute these notebooks sequentially.
