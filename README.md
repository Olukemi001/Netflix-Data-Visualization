# Netflix-Data-Visualization
This project analyses Netflix shows and movies through a modular pipeline. Each step of the pipeline such as data preparation, data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization is handled in separate Jupyter Notebooks. The entire workflow has been automated using Papermill to execute these notebooks sequentially.
